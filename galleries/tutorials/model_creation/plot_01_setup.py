# %%
#
# ------------------------
# The preparation stage
# ------------------------
# Before building a model, we need to load the used components.
# Every model needs one :py:class:`System` instance.  Furthermore,
# we are going to use several :py:class:`Node` and :py:class:`Element` instances.
#
# Loading those class definitions requires the following:

from femedu.domain import System, Node
from femedu.elements.linear import Truss
from femedu.materials import ElasticSection

# %%
# The first line imports the :py:class:`System` and :py:class:`Node` class definitions,
# the second line imports the :py:class:`Truss` from the **linear** package, i.e., the
# small deformation finite element on variational base.
#

# %%
# Start by creating a :py:class:`System` instance.

model = System()

# %%
# The `model` object will hold all information forming your finite element model, as well as provide the interface for
# analysis control, plotting, and data gathering.
#
# Next, we are creating nodes as :py:class:`Node` objects.

nd0 = Node( 0.0, 0.0)
nd1 = Node( 8.0, 6.0)
nd2 = Node(16.0, 0.0)

# %%
# It is important to understand that `nd0`, `nd1`, `nd2` are instances of :py:class:`Node` and provide
# a permanent pointer to those nodes and all their information throughout the entire analysis. We will
# use those pointers to collect data or make control decisions.
#
# We also need to add those node objects to our model.

model.addNode(nd0, nd1, nd2)

# %%
# nodes can be added one at a time or, as shown above, as a group of nodes.

# %%
# Every node holds information about
#
# .. list-table::
#    :widths: 25 50 25
#    :header-rows: 1
#
#    * - Type
#      - Description
#      - Access through
#    * - Position
#      - initial coordinates of the node
#      - `getPos()`
#    * - Displacement
#      - current displacement components
#      - `getDisp(['ux', ...])`
#    * - Attached elements
#      - Pointers to all connected elements
#      - internal
#    * - Available dofs
#      - Union of dofs used by any of the attached elements
#      - internal
#    * - Index for a dof
#      - Global index for locating each nodal dof in system arrays.
#      - `getIdx4DOFs(dof-list)`
#    * - Index for one attached element
#      - Global index array for locating element-specific dofs in system arrays.
#      - `getIdx4Element(elem)`
#

# %%
# Once nodes have been created, we can create and add elements to the model.
# This can be done by creating an element as

# define material parameters
params = dict(
    E = 1000.,   # Young's modulus
    A = 1.0,     # cross section area
)

elem0 = Truss(nd0, nd1, ElasticSection(params))

# %%
# and adding that element to the model using

model.addElement(elem0)

# %%
# or by creating and adding elements in one single step

model.addElement(Truss(nd1, nd2, ElasticSection(params)))

# %%
# The first option allows us to keep `elem0` as element pointer for later access to that element.
# The second option is sufficient in most cases.
#
# |Application| also provides a short version for the :py:meth:`addElement` function in the form

model += Truss(nd0, nd2, ElasticSection(params))

# %%
# .. note::
#
#    In |Application|, every material instance holds information about the current state of the material,
#    including strain, stress, plastic strain, hardening parameters, and more.  Since these are private
#    to any particular material point, each element requires its own material instance.
#
#    Creating one instance of :py:meth:`AnyMaterial(params)` and handing that instance
#    to the element constructor will most likely lead to a faulty model.
#

# %%
# Geometric boundary conditions are applied at nodes.  In order to add a geometric boundary condition to a node,
# we need to use the node pointer, i.e., the variable holding the :py:class:`Node` instance.
#
# In this example, we shall model `nd0` as **fixed** and `nd2` as a **horizontal roller**.

nd0.fixDOF(['ux','uy'])   # pin
nd2.fixDOF(['uy'])        # horizontal roller

# %%
# |Application| always identifies degrees of freedom (dofs) using a short name string.  Several dofs
# are predefined and used by the standard elements, though user elements and user algorithms may define
# additional variables as long as their respective name remains unique. Built-in standard dofs are shown
# in the following table.
#
# .. list-table::
#    :widths: 25 75
#    :header-rows: 1
#
#    * - Name
#      - Description
#    * - **ux**
#      - component of displacement in the x-direction
#    * - **uy**
#      - component of displacement in the y-direction
#    * - **uz**
#      - component of displacement in the z-direction
#    * - **rx**
#      - component of (linearized) rotation about the x-axis
#    * - **ry**
#      - component of (linearized) rotation about the y-axis
#    * - **rz**
#      - component of (linearized) rotation about the z-axis
#

# %%
# Now we are ready to load the model.  This example shall be limited to simple nodal loads.
# For examples of more complex load patters refer to :ref:`model_creation_02`

nd1.addLoad([-1.0],['uy'])

# %%
# We may want to review the model status before engaging in any analysis.  The easiest way is to request a
# report about the current state of the model as follows.
#
# .. warning::
#
#    A call to `model.report()` may result in a lot of output if you are working on a large model.

model.report()

# %%
# Things to note in this report:
#
# * |Application| assigns unique names to nodes and elements.  These are mostly internal identifiers
#   but may be used by the user when analyzing/debugging program output.
#   **It is recommended to use your own node and element references to access node and element data.**
# * Nodes always report their reference position, but will also report fixed dofs or applied
#   nodal loads if either was assigned to a node.
# * Once an analysis has been performed, nodes will also show their current state of displacement.

# %%
# Another easy validation of your input can be obtained using the built-in system plot.

#model.resetDisp()
model.plot(factor=0.0,
           title="Tutorial 1: Undeformed System",
           show_bc=True, show_loads=True, show_reactions=False)

# %%
# At this point we are ready for the analysis.
# Since this is a linear model, we will use the default solver, which is a :py:class:`LinearSolver` object.
#
# All we need to perform the analysis is

model.solve()

# %%
# At this point, we may just plot the deformed system

model.plot(factor=25.0,
           title="Tutorial 1: Deformed System (factor=25.0)",
           filename="tutorial01_deformed.png",
           show_loads=True, show_reactions=True)

# %%
# .. note::
#
#    Providing the *filename=* option will save the generated figure a file with the given name.
#    The name may include a full path, specifying a destination folder and filename. If no path is
#    given, the figure file will be saved to the current runtime folder.
#
#    The image file type is determined from the extension in the *filename* option.  It is recommended
#    to used ".pdf" for best quality (vector graphics for use in publications) or ".png" for web presentation.
#    Avoid ".jpg" for line-graphics like this one.

model.report()

# Truss, beam, and frame elements further allow for plotting of internal forces through the
# `beamValuePlot(variable,factor=1.0,filename='...')` method.
#
# Valid variables are
#
# .. list-table::
#    :widths: 25 75
#    :header-rows: 0
#
#    * - `'F'`
#      - Axial force (tension positive)
#    * - `'V'`
#      - transverse shear force
#    * - `'M'`
#      - Bending moment
